# propeller_design_tools (PDT)

Python 3.7 package that provides exactly what it sounds 
like by automating usage of the GPL-licensed 
CLI-utilities XFOIL and XROTOR.

Both utilities are published by professor Mark Drela (MIT).
- XFOIL: for arbitrary 2D airfoil analysis 
- XROTOR: for arbitrary propeller design schemes

PDT seeks to provide the user a set of python3 utilities
that can be used for arbitrary scripting efforts to automate
usage of both XFOIL and XROTOR while implementing its own 
unique python3.7-native algorithms to maintain local
input files, meta files, databases, and results files and
weave everything together for the user in a simple,
meaningful way.
